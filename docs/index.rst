itsdangerous
============

.. module:: itsdangerous

Sometimes you just want to send some data to untrusted environments.  But
how to do this?  The trick involves signing.  Given a key only you know
and some random data, you can cryptographically sign them and, hand it
over to someone else, and when you get the data back you can easily ensure
that nobody tampered with it.

Granted, the receiver can decode the contents and look into the package,
but they can not modify the contents unless they also have your secret
key.  So if you keep the key secret and complex, you will be fine.

Internally it uses HMAC and SHA1 for signing and bases the implementation
on the `Django signing module
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/signing/>`_.  The library is
BSD licensed and written by Armin Ronacher though most of the copyright
for the design and implementation goes to Simon Willison and the other
amazing Django people that made this library possible.

Installation
------------

You can get the library directly from PyPI::

    pip install itsdangerous

Example Use Cases
-----------------

-   You can serialize and sign a user ID for unsubscribing of newsletters
    into URLs.  This way you don't need to generate one-time tokens and
    store them in the database.  Same thing with any kind of activation
    link for accounts and similar things.
-   Signed objects can be stored in cookies or other untrusted sources
    which means you don't need to have sessions stored on the server which
    reduces the number of necessary database queries.
-   Signed information can safely do a roundtrip between server and client
    in general which makes them useful for passing server-side state to a
    client and then back.

Signing Interface
-----------------

The most basic interface is the signing interface.  With :class:`Signer`
can be used to attach a signature to a specific string:

>>> from itsdangerous import Signer
>>> s = Signer('secret-key')
>>> s.sign('my string')
'my string.wh6tMHxLgJqB6oY1uT73iMlyrOA'
    
The signature is appended to the string, separated by a dot (``.``).  To
validate the string, use the :meth:`~Signer.unsign` method:

>>> s.unsign('my string.wh6tMHxLgJqB6oY1uT73iMlyrOA')
'my string'

If unicode strings are provided, an implicit encoding to utf-8 happens.
However after unsigning you won't be able to tell if it was unicode or
a bytestring.

If the unsining fails you will get an exception:

>>> s.unsign('my string.wh6tMHxLgJqB6oY1uT73iMlyrOX')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
itsdangerous.BadSignature: Signature "wh6tMHxLgJqB6oY1uT73iMlyrOX" does not match

Signatures with Timestamps
--------------------------

If you want to expire signatures you can use the :class:`TimestampSigner`
which will additionally put a timestamp information in and sign this.
On unsigning you can validate if the timestamp did not expire:

>>> from itsdangerous import TimestampSigner
>>> s = TimestampSigner('secret-key')
>>> string = s.sign('foo')
>>> s.unsign(string, max_age=5)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
itsdangerous.SignatureExpired: Signature age 15 > 5 seconds

Serialization
-------------

Because strings are hard to handle this module also provides a
serilization interface similar to json/pickle and others.  Internally
it does in fact use simplejson by default which however can be changed
if you subclass.  The :class:`Serializer` class implements that:

>>> from itsdangerous import Serializer
>>> s = Serializer('secret-key')
>>> s.dumps([1, 2, 3, 4])
'[1, 2, 3, 4].r7R9RhGgDPvvWl3iNzLuIIfELmo'

And it can of course also load:

>>> s.loads('[1, 2, 3, 4].r7R9RhGgDPvvWl3iNzLuIIfELmo')
[1, 2, 3, 4]

If you want to have the timestamp attached you can use the
:class:`TimedSerializer`.

URL Safe Serialization
----------------------

Often it is helpful if you can pass these trusted strings to environments
where you only have a limited set of characters available.  Because of
this, itsdangerous also provides URL safe serializers:

>>> from itsdangerous import URLSafeSerializer
>>> s = URLSafeSerializer('secret-key')
>>> s.dumps([1, 2, 3, 4])
'WzEsMiwzLDRd.wSPHqC0gR7VUqivlSukJ0IeTDgo'
>>> s.loads('WzEsMiwzLDRd.wSPHqC0gR7VUqivlSukJ0IeTDgo')
[1, 2, 3, 4]

.. _the-salt:

The Salt
--------

All classes also accept a salt argument.  The name might me misleading
because usually if you think of salts in cryptography you would expect the
salt to be something that is stored alongside the resulting signed string
as a way to prevent rainbow table lookups.  Such salts are usually public.

In “itsdangerous” like in the original Django implementation, the salt
serves a different purpose.  You could describe it as namespacing.  It's
still not critical if you disclose it because without the secret key it
does not help an attacker.

Let's assume that you have to links you want to sign.  You have the
activation link on your system which can activate a user account and then
you have an upgrade link that can upgrade a user's account to a paid
account which you send out via email.  If in both cases all you sign is
the user ID a user could reuse the variable part in the URL from the
activation link to upgrade the account.  Now you could either put more
information in there which you sign (like the intention: upgrade or
activate), but you could also use different salts:

>>> s1 = URLSafeSerializer('secret-key', salt='activate-salt')
>>> s1.dumps(42)
'NDI.kubVFOOugP5PAIfEqLJbXQbfTxs'
>>> s2 = URLSafeSerializer('secret-key', salt='upgrade-salt')
>>> s2.dumps(42)
'NDI.7lx-N1P-z2veJ7nT1_2bnTkjGTE'
>>> s2.loads(s1.dumps(42))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
itsdangerous.BadSignature: Signature "kubVFOOugP5PAIfEqLJbXQbfTxs" does not match

Only the serializer with the same salt can load the value:

>>> s2.loads(s2.dumps(42))
42
